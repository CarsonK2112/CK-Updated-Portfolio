# Unit 08 Project 1 Homework: Professional Materials

With this addition to my Portfolio I have added links to my Github profile, my Linkedin, my Project 1, and my two best homework assignments. My Github and Linkedin do not reflect an interest in coding because I have no intention of becoming a professional coder once this course is completed.

I updated the portfolio by adding cards with links in the portfolio.
